  abstract = {Reduction in the cost of genomic assays has generated large amounts of biomedical-related data. As a result, current studies perform multiple experiments in the same subjects. While Bioconductor's methods and classes implemented in different packages manage individual experiments, there is not a standard class to properly manage different omic datasets from the same subjects. In addition, most R/Bioconductor packages that have been designed to integrate and visualize biological data often use basic data structures with no clear general methods, such as subsetting or selecting samples.},

  abstract = {Genes are pleiotropic and getting a better knowledge of their function requires a comprehensive characterization of their mutants. Here, we generated multi-level data combining phenomic, proteomic and metabolomic acquisitions from plasma and liver tissues of two C57BL/6\,N mouse models lacking the Lat (linker for activation of T cells) and the Mx2 (MX dynamin-like GTPase 2) genes, respectively. Our dataset consists of 9 assays (1 preclinical, 2 proteomics and 6 metabolomics) generated with a fully non-targeted and standardized approach. The data and processing code are publicly available in the ProMetIS R package to ensure accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The dataset thus provides unique molecular information about the physiological role of the Lat and Mx2 genes. Furthermore, the protocols described herein can be easily extended to a larger number of individuals and tissues. Finally, this resource will be of great interest to develop new bioinformatic and biostatistic methods for multi-omics data integration.},

  abstract = {To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies, exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.},
